# NTQbot
This project is a chatbot application built using a stack of modern technologies: React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage. The application uses GeminiAPI to handle natural language processing (NLP) for user interactions. The chatbot provides a user-friendly interface where users can interact with the bot, ask questions, and receive intelligent responses.

# Tech Stack

## Frontend (React & CSS):
- The frontend is developed with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Custom CSS is used for styling the chat interface to ensure a smooth and engaging user experience.
- GeminiAPI is integrated into the frontend to process and understand user queries, allowing the chatbot to respond accurately in real time.

### Backend (Node.js & MongoDB):
- Node.js handles the server-side logic and API requests.
- MongoDB is used to store user data, chat logs, and other necessary information.
